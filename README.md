AquaClean - AI-powered portable water purifier with monitoring

AquaClean combines advanced filtration with AI-driven water quality monitoring to create a robust solution for diverse water purification needs.
- **Real-Time AI Monitoring**
AquaClean’s sensors provide real-time data on water quality, using AI to detect contaminants and alert users, ensuring safe water at all times. This feature continuously assesses parameters like pH, turbidity, and pathogen levels.

- **UV-C Sterilization and Filtration**  
AquaCleanincludes multi-stage filtration and UV-C sterilization, removing bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals from water sources.

- **Data Logging for Water Safety**  
The platform logs data with SQL databases in a Flask-based app, allowing users to track water quality history and make informed decisions about water sources.

## How we built it
- **AI Modeling**  
We trained an AI model on water quality data, focusing on contamination patterns and sensor integration to trigger real-time alerts. AquaClean’s AI operates seamlessly with its sensors to provide reliable, continuous monitoring.

- **Product Design**  
Using CAD software, we designed AquaCleanto be portable and durable. The design also prioritizes user-friendliness, with an easy-to-read LED display and a Flask-based web interface.

- **Web App Development**  
We implemented a Flask app using Python, SQL, and Jinja templates, enabling users to monitor water quality, track historical data, and receive alerts. Flask handles backend operations, with Jinja for dynamic HTML rendering.

- **IoT and Hardware Integration**  
IoT sensors feed real-time data into the device’s AI system. The UV-C filtration unit, a rechargeable battery, and various sensors work in harmony for reliable purification.
